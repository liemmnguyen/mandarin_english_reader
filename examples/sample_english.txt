The Little Prince

Once upon a time, there was a little prince who lived on a small planet.
The planet was so small that he could walk around it in just a few minutes.

One day, he decided to leave his planet and explore the universe.
He visited many different planets and met many interesting people.

On the first planet, he met a king who ruled over nothing.
The king was very lonely and wanted someone to rule over.

On the second planet, he met a vain man who only cared about being admired.
The man wanted everyone to think he was wonderful.

Finally, the little prince came to Earth.
Here he met a fox who taught him an important lesson about friendship.

The fox said, "You become responsible forever for what you have tamed."
The little prince learned that the most important things in life are not visible to the eye.
